# Plum - A simple graphics engine

![screenshot0.png](docs/images/screenshot0.png)

Plum is a simple real-time graphics engine built using OpenGL 4.1 and C++17. It features a deferred rendering pipeline and physically based shading. Users can instantiate lights, primitives, and models into the scene from the engine's GUI.

My goal in creating this engine was to synthesize and expand upon the concepts taught in [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com). This has been my first foray into 3D graphics programming with a low-level graphics API, so the program design and structure are still pretty raw (apologies!). I am still actively developing this (see [To Do](#to-do)) but plan to begin work on a Vulkan-based project once I feel like this has reached a nice stopping point.

## Requirements
* OpenGL 4.1+ support
* C++17 compiler support
* Make

## Dependencies
* [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
* [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)
* [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/)
* [Assimp](https://assimp-docs.readthedocs.io/en/)
* [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
* [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

## Running the Engine
Currently, this project requires headers (`*.h`, `*.hpp`) and binaries (e.g., `*.a`, `*.dylib`) of some of the dependencies listed above to be installed in the default include path(s) and linker search path(s), respectively:

| Dependency | In default include path(s) | In default linker search path(s) |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| GLAD       | `glad/glad.h`              | n/a                              |
| GLFW       | `GLFW/glfw3.h`             | `libglfw.3.dylib` or `libglfw.3.a` |
| GLM        | All `glm/*.hpp` headers    | n/a                              |
| Assimp     | All `assimp/*.h` and <br>`assimp/*.hpp` headers | `libassimp.dylib` (alias) and <br> `libassimp.5.4.1.dylib` |

Once the dependencies are in place, navigate to the `plum` directory and run `make` then `./main`.

    cd plum
    make
    ./main

## Features
### Renderer
